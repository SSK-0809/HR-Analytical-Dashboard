# HR-Analytical-Dashboard
 Project Overview:

In this dashboard, I utilized Power BI and Excel to create a comprehensive visual representation of various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as attrition rates, employee demographics, and job roles, enabling organizations to make informed decisions.

üíº Key Features:

Count of Employees: 1470 employees analyzed to identify key patterns.
Attrition Analysis: 237 employees marked as attrition cases, with a calculated attrition rate of 16.1%.
Average Metrics: Captured the average age, salary, and years of experience to understand workforce dynamics.
Visualized Insights: Created segmented visualizations for education, age groups, salary slabs, and job roles to pinpoint areas with high attrition and potential retention strategies.
üìä Key Visualizations:

Attrition by Education: Pie chart illustrating the educational background of employees, helping to identify trends in which educational sectors have higher attrition.
Attrition by Salary Slab: Bar graph showing how different salary brackets are impacted, providing insights into compensation-related attrition factors.
Attrition by Age Group: Column chart to categorize employee attrition by age groups, aiding in understanding generational trends.
Attrition by Years at Company: Line graph to track attrition trends over tenure, highlighting areas for retention focus.
Attrition by Job Role: Bar graph outlining job roles most affected by attrition, aiding HR in role-specific interventions.
‚öôÔ∏è Data Preparation & Processing:

In Excel, I followed a structured data transformation process:

Source Data: Imported raw employee data into Excel.
Promoted Headers: Ensured column names were correctly formatted and standardized.
Data Cleaning: Removed unwanted columns and duplicates to maintain data integrity.
Type Conversion: Converted data types to ensure compatibility and accuracy for further calculations.
Conditional Columns: Created custom columns for attrition flagging based on business logic (Attrition = Yes/No).
Grouped & Aggregated Data: Used pivot tables to categorize attrition data by various demographics.
Visualization & Analysis: Integrated pivot charts and graphs to represent data visually.
üîß This dashboard will empower HR teams to implement targeted strategies and foster a positive work environment!
